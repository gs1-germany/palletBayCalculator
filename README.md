# palletBayCalculator
This is a software prototype (current status: <b><i>DRAFT</i></b>) based on a heuristic for calculating the number of required pallet bays for an order of trade items. The underlying guideline was developed by a GS1 Germany working group.


## Demo  
An interactive demo is available at https://ralphtro.github.io/palletBayCalculator/

To calculate the total number of required pallet bays for a given order of trade items, just indicate the data for each order position:

Eine standardisierte Methode zur Transportplatzberechnung in der FMCG Branche' ('Standardised Transport Planning Criteria. A standardised approach for calculating pallet bays in the FMCG sector')
